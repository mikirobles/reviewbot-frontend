# ReviewBot Frontend

This project is a coding challenge made for Connectly.ai  

The challenge consists on developing a front-end application for a Messenger chatbot, which will ask customer for product reviews after they purchase.  

## Tech stack  

I decided to go with:
- **React.js** - This is what I mainly use for creating web apps.
- **Typescript** - I learned typescript over a year ago and I can't imagine working without it now. It makes it very easy to refactor and build code without breaking things. It also serves as documentation.
- **[Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/)** - This is a component library that I wanted to try out for this challenge. It is designed in a very modular and atomic way, kind of like Tailwind.css.
